# My C Learning Journey 🚀

Hi there! 👋 This repository documents my progress as I learn the **C programming language**. Here you will find exercises, algorithm implementations, and personal projects as I dive deeper into computer science fundamentals.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The code is organized by topics and learning sources:

- **`/cs50`**: Solutions and practice problems from Harvard's CS50 course.
- **`/concepts`**: Isolated tests to understand specific core concepts:
  - `pointers`: Pointer arithmetic and references.
  - `memory`: Dynamic memory management (`malloc`, `free`).
  - `structs`: Custom data structures.
- **`/projects`**: Small, complete applications built from scratch.

## 🛠 Tools

- **Language:** Standard C (C99/C11)
- **Compiler:** GCC / Clang

## 📝 Learning Notes

My goal is to understand what happens "under the hood" of software, focusing on:

- Manual memory management.
- Data structures (Linked lists, trees, hash tables).
- Sorting and searching algorithms.
